  <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>

   <p>
     Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the movement to teach
     <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
     command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
     everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
     Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
     We believe there are  <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
     learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our

      HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim
      Berners-Lee</a>. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to
      share pictures of his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

     In addition to hosting most of the world's supply of kitten videos, the
     Web is also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more so than this one:

       <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em>

    <h3>Founders</h3>

   <p>
     Learn Enough to Be Dangerous was founded in 2015 by Michael Hartl, Lee
     Donahoe, and Nick Merwin. We believe that the kind of technical
     sophistication taught by the Learn Enough tutorials can benefit
     at least a billion people, and probably more.
